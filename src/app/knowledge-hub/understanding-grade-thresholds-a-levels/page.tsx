                  Advanced Level qualifications, also commonly known as A
                  Levels, are higher levels of academic qualification taken by
                  aspiring students in many international schools. It typically
                  spans for two years, with A Levels being the first year and AS
                  Levels being the second year. A Level exams serve as an
                  important milestone for gaining admission to universities all
                  over the world or entering the workforce.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Grade threshold in A Levels refers to the minimum number of
                  marks that a student has to achieve to attain the required
                  grade in a paper or subject.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Do Grade Thresholds Matter?</h3>
                <p>
                  The grade thresholds in A Levels play an important role in
                  university admissions. They help determine if the students
                  meet the requirement for their university’s conditional offer.
                  These thresholds can change from year to year and paper to
                  paper, depending on the exam difficulty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover, they also give students a clear picture of how close
                  they are to a higher or lower grade, ultimately helping them
                  set measurable goals and prepare for their exams effectively.
                  Overall, grade thresholds ensure consistent, fair grading
                  across exam sessions and subjects.
                </p>

                </table>

                <h3>Why Threshold Changes Every Year?</h3>
                <p>
                  Grade thresholds are adjusted according to the difficulty
                  level of an exam. If a paper is harder than usual, the
                  threshold for getting an A might be slightly lower. So,
                  thresholds change after each year and every exam, depending on
                  how tough the paper was and how students performed in their
                  overall exam.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Exam boards like Cambridge (CAIE), Edexcel, AQA, and others
                  determine whether to make changes to the grade threshold or
                  not after all papers are marked. Understanding grade
                  thresholds helps students analyse past papers effectively, set
                  realistic revision goals, and avoid stressing over their
                  scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Knowing how thresholds work can help you approach your exams
                  with greater clarity and confidence, whether you're aiming for
                  top marks or simply trying to get good grades in exams.
                </p>
